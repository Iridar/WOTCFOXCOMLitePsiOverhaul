Psionics can be researched earlier in the campaign, as they now require only the Sectoid Autopsy, and no elerium crystals.
Building and maintaining a Psi Lab now costs the same amount of resources, time and power as Proving Grounds.

Any soldier above rookie can undergo training in the Psi Lab.
Doing so will insert psionic abilities in their tree and grant them access to the Psi Amp slot.
Psionic abilities can be unlocked via soldier's regular promotions or by spending Ability Points.
