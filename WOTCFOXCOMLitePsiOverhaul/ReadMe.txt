[WOTC] FOXCOM Psionics 2.0

This mod overhauls the psionic system to make it work like it did in XCOM Enemy Within, where any soldier can become a psionic.

[h1]Strategic Changes[/h1]
[list]
[*] Psionics are available earlier: Psionics research no longer requires Elerium Crystals. 
[*] Psi Lab costs less to build and maintain.
[*] Psi Lab staffs a scientist instead of an engineer.
[/list]
[h1]Psionic Evaluation Chamber[/h1]
[list]
[*] Except for robotic units, any soldier of any class can undergo Psionic Evaluation in the Psi Lab to determine if they have The Gift. Default chance is 25%.
[*] If the soldier has The Gift, the gain a Psi Amp slot, a free psionic ability, and a row of additional psionic abilities is inserted into their soldier class ability tree. These abilities can be unlocked by spending promotions or ability points, same as regular soldier class perks.
[*] Psionic abilities are intelligently randomized: abilities that require each other to be useful are always placed near each other, and more powerful abilities become available at later ranks.
[*] The vanilla Psi Operative class is disabled by default. You can bring it back by toggling the MCM setting that will allow you to send Rookies to undergo Psionic Evaluation in the Psi Lab. If they have The Gift, they will become a Psi Operative.
[*] Psi Offense is increased by unlocking certain psionic abilities. The amount will be listed in the ability description.
[/list]
[h1]Psionic Infusion Chamber[/h1]
[list]
[*] Psi Infusion chamber becomes available after upgrading the Psi Lab.
[*] It can be used to grant psi abilities to soldiers without The Gift, in case you have specific soldiers you really want to become psionic.
[*] Psionic Infusion costs an Elerium Core and takes longer than Psi Evaluation.
[*] Psionic Infusion can also be performed on soldiers who already use psionic weapons, such as Shard Gauntlets and Psi Amp, as their class weapons. 
[*] In other words, you can grant additional psi abilities to Templars or other similar soldiers.
[/list]
[h1]Misc[/h1]
If you have Character Pool soldiers who you want to always be psionic for narrative reasons (e.g. Annette Durand), you can ensure they will have The Gift by assigning the Psi Operative class to them in the Character Pool. This option needs to be enabled in Mod Config Menu.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
Psionic soldiers from this mod won't count as psionic units for the few gameplay mechanics that care about it. Future Highlander updates may address this issue. Note that other psionic overhauls also have this issue.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]
The mod is configurable via Mod Config Menu and through various files in: 
[code]..\steamapps\workshop\content\268500\3116527810\Config\[/code]
