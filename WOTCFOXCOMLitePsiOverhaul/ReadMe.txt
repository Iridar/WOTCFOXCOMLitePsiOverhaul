[WOTC] FOXCOM Psionics

This is a yet another overhaul of the psionic system to make it function similar to how it was in Enemy Within.[list]
[*] Psionics are available earlier: [b]Psionics[/b] research no longer requires Elerium Crystals. Psi Lab costs less to build and maintain.
[*] Any soldier of any class can undergo Psionic Evaluation to see if they have The Gift.
[*] If the soldier has The Gift, they gain a Psi Amp slot, and a row of psionic abilities is inserted into their ability tree.
[*] One psionic ability is unlocked for free immediately.
[*] The rest of the abilities can be unlocked as if they were regular soldier class perks, by spending promotions or ability points.
[*] The ability selection is intelligently randomized. 
[*] The vanilla Psi Operative class is disabled by default, but if you want to have it in addition to new psionics, you can enable it in MCM and send Rookies to undergo Psionic Evaluation in the Psi Lab.
[*] Unlocking certain psionic abilities will increase your soldier's Psi Offense.
[/list]

[h1]The Gift Mechanics[/h1]
[list][*] Normally, soldiers have a 20% chance to have The Gift. 
[*] If there's a particular soldier you want to become a psionic, but they don't have The Gift, you can build an Aurora Shard in the Proving Grounds for Elerium Crystals, and send them to the Psi Lab again. The Shard will be consumed in the process.
[*] You can also guarantee The Gift for specific soldiers setting the Psi Operative class for them in Character Pool.
[*] The Gift is always granted to soldiers that use a Psi Amp or Shard Gauntlets as their class weapons, but these soldiers don't receive a free psionic perk.
[*] If the Psi Amp is the soldier's only secondary weapon, they will not get the free Psi Amp slot.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

Psionic soldiers from this mod will not count as psionic units for the few gameplay mechanics that care about it. Hopefully, this will be addressed by future Highlander updates. Note this is also the case for other psionic overhauls as well.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

The mod is configurable via Mod Config Menu and through various files in:
