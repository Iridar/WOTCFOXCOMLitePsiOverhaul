[WOTC] FOXCOM Psionics

This is a yet another overhaul of the psionic system, aiming to make it function similarly to how it did in Enemy Within.
[list][*] Psionics are available earlier: Psionics research no longer requires Elerium Crystals. Psi Lab costs less to build and maintain.
[*] Any soldier of any class can undergo Psionic Evaluation to determine if they have The Gift, except for robotic units.
[*] If the soldier has The Gift, they gain a Psi Amp slot, and a row of psionic abilities is inserted into their ability tree.
[*] One psionic ability is unlocked for free immediately.
[*] The remaining abilities can be unlocked by spending promotions or ability points, same as regular soldier class perks.
[*] The ability selection is intelligently randomized.
[*] The vanilla Psi Operative class is disabled by default. You can bring it back by toggling the MCM setting that will allow you to send Rookies to undergo Psionic Evaluation in the Psi Lab.
[*] Unlocking certain psionic abilities will increase the soldier's Psi Offense.[/list]

[h1]The Gift Mechanics[/h1]
[list][*] Normally, soldiers have a 25% chance to have The Gift.
[*] If you have a particular soldier without The Gift who you really want to become a psionic, you can build an Aurora Shard out of Elerium Cores in the Proving Grounds, then send the soldier to the Psi Lab again for another Psionic Evaluation. The Shard will be consumed, guaranteeing the soldier will have The Gift this time.
[*] You can also ensure The Gift for specific soldiers by assigning the Psi Operative class to them in the Character Pool.
[*] Soldiers using a Psi Amp or Shard Gauntlets as their class weapons always possess The Gift, but they don't receive a free psionic perk.
[*] If the Psi Amp is the soldier's only secondary weapon, they won't gain access to the free Psi Amp slot.[/list]

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
Psionic soldiers from this mod won't count as psionic units for the few gameplay mechanics that care about it. Future Highlander updates may address this issue. Note that other psionic overhauls also have this issue.
